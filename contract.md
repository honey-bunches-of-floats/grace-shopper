Team expectations
Don’t be an @$$h0l3
Commit and push often
Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
Be respectful of one anothers’ talking time
Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
Don’t just say ‘no’ - counter with an alternative solution or provide constructive critique
At least message the group when you change what you are working on
Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes
Bring up any issues after spinning your wheels for 30 minutes
Issues
If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:

1.       Take 10-15 minute break
2.       Talk out the pros / cons
3.       If unable to resolve, escalate to a fellow or instructor
    If you are frustrated
    Take a walk or get some water
    Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
    Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. team member, fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
